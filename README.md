# Step-by-Step Instructions on Building a Drone
This document will walk you through the process of building a drone. These instructions will include the major steps needed and also include small steps, tricks, and tips that we found useful along the way.

## Frame
The Frame is a good place to start; we use a [s500](https://a.co/d/acLCxvA) frame.

### Steps for Assembling the Frame
1. **Prepare the frame kit**: Unpack all the components.
2. **Assemble the arms**: Attach each arm to the central plate using the provided screws.
3. **Secure the base**: Ensure all screws are tightened and secure to prevent any looseness during flight.

## Motors
Now we can work on the motors. Here we are using [Mn3110-15 KV780 motors](https://store.tmotor.com/goods-334-MN3110.html). You will also need to get [prop adapters]()
### Steps for Installing the Motors
1. **Position the motors**: Place each motor on the designated spots at the ends of the arms.
2. **Secure the motors**: Use screws to fasten each motor to the frame.
3. **Connect motor wires**: Route the wires from the motors towards the center of the frame for connection to the ESCs.

## Props
We use [11x4.7SF](https://www.apcprop.com/product/11x4-7sf/) and [11x4.7SFP](https://www.apcprop.com/product/11x4-7sfp/) props
### Steps for Attaching the Props
1. **Check prop direction**: Ensure that each prop is facing the correct direction for optimal thrust.
2. **Attach props to motors**: Screw each prop onto its respective motor, using a tightening tool if necessary.

## ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers)
### Steps for Installing ESCs
1. **Attach ESCs to the frame**: Secure each ESC next to its corresponding motor.
2. **Connect ESCs to motors**: Solder the motor wires to their respective ESCs.
3. **Route power wires**: Organize and secure the power wires towards the battery compartment.

## Battery
### Steps for Preparing the Battery
1. **Select the right battery**: Ensure the battery is suitable for your drone's power requirements.
2. **Check the charge**: Always start with a fully charged battery for testing.

### Battery Mount
#### Steps for Installing the Battery Mount
1. **Install the mount**: Secure the battery mount to the frame.
2. **Place the battery**: Insert the battery into the mount and secure it with straps.

## Flight Controller
### Steps for Setting Up the Flight Controller
1. **Mount the flight controller**: Place it in the middle of the frame.
2. **Connect to ESCs**: Connect the flight controller to the ESCs using the signal wires.
3. **Calibrate the flight controller**: Follow manufacturer instructions for calibration.

## RC (Remote Control)
### Steps for Configuring the RC
1. **Bind the transmitter to the receiver**: Follow the binding instructions specific to your RC model.
2. **Test control response**: Ensure all movements are correctly mapped and responsive.
3. **Adjust settings as necessary**: Fine-tune the settings for optimal performance.

These are the broad steps for each component involved in building a drone. Please follow detailed instructions specific to each part and manufacturer guidelines.
